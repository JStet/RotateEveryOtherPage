# RotateEveryOtherPage

This ridiculously simple and creatively named Bash script was written to solve an annoying problem I recently faced. Every other page of some scanned pdf files I had to read for university was turned upside down. I made use of [pdftk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/).

## Dependecies

Pdftk

## Installation

Just clone and make it executable (maybe add it to your PATH).

## Usage

Depends on how you execute it. One way would be the following.

```
bash RotateEveryOtherPage180 input.pdf output.pdf

```

In the resulting dialog just answer whether the first page is turned upside down to determine if the odd or the even pages are the ones that need rotating.
